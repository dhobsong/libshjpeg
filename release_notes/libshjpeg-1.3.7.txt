libshjpeg Release 1.3.7
=======================

libshjpeg: A library for controlling the SH-Mobile JPU

The source archive is available from

	https://github.com/dhobsong/libshjpeg

New in this release
-------------------
Thread safety
  Multiple images can now be decoded/encoded in parallel from
  different threads in the same process.  Both native and libjpeg
  interfaces can be used
     * new tests added: shjpeg_multithread, libjpeg_multithread to
       test this functinality.

Use libshveu for accessing the VEU
  * color conversion is now performed via libshveu.  The libshveu
    library is now necessary to compile this project.
    Source for libshveu can be found at:
        https://github.com/pedwo/libshveu

Use UIOMux for memory allocation and resource locking
  * The UIOMux library is now necessary to compile this project
    Source for UIOMUx can be found at:
        https://github.com/pedwo/libuiomux

Minor documentation clarifications

Phil Edworthy (10):
      Move JPU & VEU interrupt handling into functions
      Move the code to start the VEU into a function
      Move sw convert code into function
      tests: Add an option to allow sw color space conversion
      Fix JPU control loop when using sw color space conversion
      Mainly cosmetic changes.
      Move code into a start_jpu function & minor tidy up
      tests: add ability to decode other formats
      Rework JPU loop to split JPU & VEU wait for events
      Replace direct access to VEU with calls to libshveu library
