The hardware accelerated JPEG encoder/decoder library for Renesas
SH-Mobile and R-Mobile/R-Car SoCs.
This makes use of the Renesas SoC's JPU.  If JPEG files cannot be
decoded, automatically falls back to libjpeg.

Run 'autoreconf -vif' to create 'configure'.

Then, run ./configure. You must have libjpeg, libuiomux in order to
compile properly. And also you should have libshvio if you want
the RGB color space support for decoder output and encoder input.

libuiomux can be found at: https://github.com/renesas-devel/libuiomux
libshvio can be found at: https://github.com/renesas-devel/libshvio

You can find 4 sample codes in ./tests/ directory. Possible options
on these sample codes can be found by giving '--help' as a command
line option.

shjpegtest    - Decode and then encode the JPEG file.

v2mjpeg	      - Encode V4L2 input, and stream as multipart/x-mixed-replace.
		Use with sighttpd (http://github.com/kfish/sighttpd).

mjpeg2jpeg.pl - Retrieve v2mjpeg/sighttpd output via http, and stores as
		individual JPEG files.

libjpegtest   - Decode and then encode a JPEG file using the libjpeg interface.

shjpegtest_multithread - Simultaneously encode and decode data from two threads

libjpeg_multithread - Simultaneously decode and encode data from two threads
		      using the libjpeg interface.

See libshjpeg.txt for more details about the library
