The hardware accelerated JPEG encoder/decoder library for SH Mobile.
This makes use of Renesas's SH7722/4 SoC's JPU.  If JPEG files
cannot be decoded, automatically falls back to libjpeg.

Run 'autoreconf -vif' to create 'configure'.

Then, run ./configure. You must have libjpeg, libuiomux, and libshveu,
in order to compile properly.

libuiomux can be found at: https://github.com/pedwo/libuiomux
libshveu can be found at: https://github.com/pedwo/libshveu

You can find 4 sample codes in ./tests/ directory. Possible options
on these sample codes can be found by giving '--help' as a command
line option.

shjpegtest    - Decode and then encode the JPEG file.

v2mjpeg	      - Encode V4L2 input, and stream as multipart/x-mixed-replace.
		Use with sighttpd (http://github.com/kfish/sighttpd).

mjpeg2jpeg.pl - Retrieve v2mjpeg/sighttpd output via http, and stores as
		individual JPEG files.

libjpegtest   - Decode and then encode a JPEG file using the libjpeg interface.

shjpegtest_multithread - Simultaneously encode and decode data from two threads

libjpeg_multithread - Simultaneously decode and encode data from two threads
		      using the libjpeg interface.

See libshjpeg.txt for more details about the library
