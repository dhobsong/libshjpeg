The hardware accelerated JPEG encoder/decoder library for SH Mobile.
This makes use of Renesas's SH7722/4 SoC's JPU.  If JPEG files
cannot be decoded, automatically falls back to libjpeg.

Run 'autoreconf -vif' to create 'configure'.

Then, run ./configure. You must have libjpeg in order to compile
properly.
